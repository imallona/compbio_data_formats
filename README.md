# Slides

The course slides cover first why do we need scripted workflows with data stored using standards, in context of the best practices for scientific reproducibility; and after that discuss sequence formats (fasta, fastq), coordinate-based formats (BED, SAM, GTF, VCF..) and finally presents some tricks in efficience and speed-up (Wiggle files, indexed binary formats).

Slides are linked to exercises (see below) that largely differ in complexity.

* [Why good practices and data standards?](slides/1_why_standards_and_reproducibility.pdf)
* [Introduction to data formats in genomics](slides/2_genomic_data_formats.pdf)

# Why? Good practices in computational biology

Computational biology needs high standards to make results reproducible, track work, organize projects and collaborate with colleagues.

To accomplish this we rely on sharing data and results using data standards (lingua franca) dealing with them using powerful and open tools (UNIX).

# Set up

## Folders

Setting up a working directory with folders


```bash
cd ~                             # goes to the home directory
mkdir -p course
ls -l course

mkdir -p course/data course/soft # multiple directories can be created at once

ls -l course

```

## Retrieving data

Downloading text files and checking their details.

```bash
cd  ~/course/data

curl http://gattaca.imppc.org/groups/maplab/imallona/teaching/example.bed \
   > example.bed

curl http://gattaca.imppc.org/groups/maplab/imallona/teaching/hg19.genome \
   > hg19.genome

file example.bed     # which kind of file is it, is it text?
ls -lah example.bed  # how big?
head example.bed     # how do the first lines look like?

file hg19.genome
ls -lah hg19.genome
head hg19.genome

```

## Retrieving software/compiling (bedtools)

Retrieving source code and using a Makefile to compile exactly the software version required is a standard task in computational biology. Importantly, this can be scripted to make sure of dependencies/version. In this example we'll install bedtools (if not yet installed, which can be tested typing `bedtools --help` in a terminal).

```bash
cd
mkdir -p course/soft

cd course/soft

curl -L https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/releases/download/v2.25.0/bedtools-2.25.0.tar.gz \
  > bedtools-2.25.0.tar.gz

tar zxvf bedtools-2.25.0.tar.gz
cd bedtools2
make  # will take time! you could read about Makefiles during compiling time
alias bedtools='~/course/soft/bedtools2/bin/bedtools'

bedtools --help

```

# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Find the number of lines of the file `~/course/data/example.bed`


<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

Note the `-l` flag
```bash
wc -l ~/course/data/example.bed
```

</p>
</details>


## Exercise 2

Get the manual page of `head`, what is this command for?

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

```bash
man head
```

</p>
</details>

## Exercise 3

Get the first 5 lines of the file `~/course/data/example.bed`

<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

```bash
head -5 ~/course/data/example.bed
```

</p>
</details>

## Exercise 4

Using pipes (`|`): chain the `head -5` command before with  `wc -l` to make sure the number of lines was as expected (5).

Seems a stupid thing to do? Actually it's a good idea to check some results during routine computational biology runs, i.e. whether the number of genes checked remains the same across samples and similar things. Negative and positive controls are easily transferable from wetlab to drylab [read more about unit testing in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing).


<details><summary>Answer</summary>
<p>

```bash
head -5 ~/course/data/example.bed | wc -l
```

# FASTQ/A Exercises

DISCLAIMER: data is based upon the beautiful Genome Analysis Workshop (MOLB 7621) Course on genome analysis at the University of Colorado SOM at [https://github.com/MOLB7621](https://github.com/MOLB7621)

## Exercise 5

Retrieve the data for these exercises (mind the path you're working at, should be `~/course/data`).

The path for URL for the data is https://molb7621.github.io/workshop/_downloads/SP1.fq


<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash
cd ~/course/data
curl -L https://molb7621.github.io/workshop/_downloads/SP1.fq  \
   > SP1.fq
```

</p>
</details>


##  Exercise 6

(Source: [MOLB7621](https://molb7621.github.io/workshop/Syllabus.html))

Inspect the file from the previous exercise (file size, number of lines, and visualize its head)


<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash
cd  ~/course/data
ls -lh SP1.fq
wc -l SP1.fq

head SP1.fq
```

</p>
</details>

## Exercise 7

(Source: [MOLB7621](https://molb7621.github.io/workshop/Syllabus.html))

The FASTQ file stored at `~/course/data/SP1.fq` is in [FASTQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format) format, meaning it contains 4 lines per read sequence. 

```bash
head -n 4 SP1.fq
```

produces

```
@cluster_2:UMI_ATTCCG
TTTCCGGGGCACATAATCTTCAGCCGGGCGC
+
9C;=;=<9@4868>9:67AA<9>65<=>591
```

* So Line 1 contains a sequence identifier that begins with an `@`
* Line 2 contains the read sequence (A,T,C,G,N) 
* Line 3 is a comment line, often unused and only contains a `+` 
* Line 4 is the Phred quality score for each sequence encoded in ASCII format 

First use ``wc`` and ``awk`` to determine the number of *sequences* in the fastq 


<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash
cd ~/course/data/
wc -l SP1.fq  # total number of lines
wc -l SP1.fq | awk '{print $1 / 4}' # total number of fastq records

```
</p>
</details>

## Exercise 8

(Source: [MOLB7621](https://molb7621.github.io/workshop/Syllabus.html))

A common mistake is to use ``grep`` to pattern match the ``@`` in the
sequence identifier. Why doesn't this work?

```bash
wc -l SP1.fq | awk '{print $1 / 4}'
```
renders `250`

```bash
grep -c "@" SP1.fq
```
renders `459`.
<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>
`@` is a valid quality score, so lines of phred scores will be counted as well when using grep
</p>
</details>

## Exercise 9

(Source: [MOLB7621](https://molb7621.github.io/workshop/Syllabus.html))

Next, extract out the read *sequences* from the fastq. This is a bit
complicated as we need to only pull out the second line from each record. 



<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>


One approach to this problem is to use the ``%`` `modulo
operator` ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation)), which returns
the remainder after division of two integers. For example using ``awk``

```bash
awk 'BEGIN { {print 4 % 2}}'
awk 'BEGIN { {print 4 % 3}}'
awk 'BEGIN { {print 5 % 3}}'
awk 'BEGIN { {print 1 % 4}}'
```

In ``awk`` there is a special variable ``NR`` which is equal to the
current line number.

So let's extract the sequences of the fasta file `SP1.fq`


```bash

awk 'NR%4==2'   ~/course/data/SP1.fq

```

</p>
</details>

## Exercise 10

Print the line numbers of the file `SP1.fq`

<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash
awk '{print NR}' ~/course/data/SP1.fq
```
</p>
</details>


We can also prepend the line number to the FASTQ file (please note we asume `SP1.fq` is on the working directory)

Tip: `awk '{print $0 }'` filename prints the whole line, to which you can add the ``NR``.

```bash
awk '{print NR, $0 }' SP1.fq | head # note output in first column

```

## Exercise 11

(Source: [MOLB7621](https://molb7621.github.io/workshop/Syllabus.html))

We can use the modulo operator with ``NR`` to only capture specific
records from the fastq


```bash

awk 'NR % 4 == 1' SP1.fq | head  # get header line
awk 'NR % 4 == 2' SP1.fq | head  # get sequence line
awk 'NR % 4 == 3' SP1.fq | head  # get comment line
awk 'NR % 4 == 0' SP1.fq | head  # get quality line
```

<!-- ## Exercise 12 -->


<!-- Now that we can isolate only the sequences let's use `sort` and `uniq` to -->
<!-- find common sequences.  -->

<!-- ```bash -->

<!-- awk 'NR % 4 == 2' SP1.fq \  # get sequences -->
<!--       | sort \  # sort the sequences  -->
<!--       | uniq -c \ # report number of occurances of each unique sequence -->
<!--       | head  -->
      
<!-- #show most frequent sequences -->
      
<!-- awk 'NR % 4 == 2' SP1.fq \  -->
<!--       | sort \ -->
<!--       | uniq -c \ -->
<!--       | sort -k1,1nr \ # reverse sort to rank by most common sequence -->
<!--       | head -->
<!-- ``` -->


## Exercise 12

(Source: [MOLB7621](https://molb7621.github.io/workshop/Syllabus.html))

FASTA format is a more compact sequence format than FASTQ

```bash
>sequence_identifier_1
ATCGTCGATGCTAGTCGA
>sequence_identifier_2
AGCTAGCTAGCTAGC
```

Convert fastq to fasta (tip: use lines 1 and 2)


<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash

awk 'NR % 4 == 1 {print ">"$1}; 
     NR % 4 == 2 {print}' SP1.fq \
     | head 
```
</p>
</details>


## Exercise 13

Save the SP1 sequences as a file in fasta format (named `~/course/data/example.fa`)

<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash

awk 'NR % 4 == 1 {print ">"$1}; 
     NR % 4 == 2 {print}' SP1.fq \
     > ~/course/data/example.fa
```

or, equivalently (data is one-column),

```bash

awk 'NR % 4 == 1 {print ">"$0}; 
     NR % 4 == 2 {print}' SP1.fq \
     > ~/course/data/example.fa
```

</p>
</details>


## Exercise 14

Make sure the number of sequences is the same in both fastq and fasta files

<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash
awk 'NR % 4 == 1' SP1.fq | wc -l
awk 'NR % 2 == 1' example.fa | wc -l

```
</p>
</details>


# SAM format

## Exercise 15

Download the compressed SAM data from ` https://github.com/samtools/samtools/raw/develop/examples/ex1.sam.gz`,  uncompress (`.gz` files need to be uncompressed with `gunzip`) and inspect it.

<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash
cd ~/course/data

curl -L https://github.com/samtools/samtools/raw/develop/examples/ex1.sam.gz \
  > ex1.sam.gz

gunzip ex1.sam.gz
head ex1.sam
```
</p>
</details>

# BED format

## Exercise 16

<!-- bed6 to bed3 -->

Transform the file `~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/a.bed` (BED6) to BED3 (tip: use awk to extract the first three columns).

Tip: `OFS='\t'` in awk specifies the output field separator: a tab (`\t`).

<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash

## to go to the a.bed file directory
cd ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/

awk -v OFS='\t' '{print $1,$2,$3}' a.bed

cd - ## to go back to the previous directory

```
</p>
</details>


## Exercise 17

Transform the BED3 file ` ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/recordsOutOfOrder.bed` to BED6 (unspecified strand, 0 score)

Tip: check the [BED6 file specification](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1)

<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash

## to go to the a.bed file directory
cd ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/

awk -v OFS='\t' '{print $1,$2,$3,".",0,"."}' \
  recordsOutOfOrder.bed

cd - ## to go back to the previous directory

```
</p>
</details>


## Exercise 18

Add a nucleotide to the start and subtract a nucleotide to the end to all records, regardless of the strand, to the file `~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/a.bed`.

Tip: use `awk`.

<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash

## to go to the a.bed file directory
cd ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/

awk -v OFS='\t' '{print $1,$2-1,$3+1,$4,$5,$6}' a.bed

cd - ## to go back to the previous directory

```
</p>
</details>



<!-- awk half open etc -->


## Exercise 19


Use [bedtools intersect](http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/intersect.html#intersect) to find overlapping genomic features. The [BEDtools paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2832824/) is also very helpful to understand the genomic arithmetics analysis (without sequences, using coordinates).

For this and the next exercises we use some example datasets from the bedtools sourcecode we compiled in one of the first activities. For instance, you could check them i.e. at `~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/`.

Check the `~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/a.bed` and `~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/b.bed` files content. Are they BED3, BED6 or BED12 files?

<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash

cat ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/a.bed
cat ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/b.bed
```
</p>
</details>

## Exercise 20

What will happen if you intersect those files? For example, the `a.bed` region chr1:100-200 overlaps with `b.bed`

```bash

bedtools intersect \
  -a  ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/a.bed \
  -b  ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/b.bed

```

Which is the format of the output? How are results interpreted?

<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

The output is a direct intersect:

```bash

chr1	100	101	a2	2	-
chr1	100	110	a2	2	-
```

Starting from the original interval from a.bed:

```bash
chr1        100     200     a2      2       -

```

And the overlapping intervals from b.bed:

```bash
chr1        90      101     b2      2       -
chr1        100     110     b3      3       +
```

</p>
</details>

## Exercise 21

What does it happen if running `bedtools intersect` with the `a.bed` file as `-b` and the `b.bed` file as `-a`?


<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash

bedtools intersect \
  -b  ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/a.bed \
  -a  ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/b.bed
```

Tip: check the strands
</p>
</details>

## Exercise 22

Run bedtools intersect with the `a.bed` file as `-a`,  the `b.bed` file as `-b` but forcing strandness, i.e. reporting hits in B that overlap A on the same strand

<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash

bedtools intersect \
  -s \
  -a  ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/a.bed \
  -b  ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/b.bed
```
  
</p>
</details>

## Exercise 23

Use the `-v` to report those intervals in `a.bed` that do not overlap any of the intervals in `b.bed`.


<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash

bedtools intersect \
  -v \
  -a  ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/a.bed \
  -b  ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/b.bed
```

You can explore what happens if inverting the -a and -b flags; for this the -wa and -wb flags might be helpful

```bash

bedtools intersect \
  -v \
  -wa -wb \
  -b  ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/a.bed \
  -a  ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/b.bed
  ```
  
</p>
</details>


## Exercise 24


Use the `-wao` flag to report the amounts of overlap for all features when comparing `a.bed` and `b.bed`, including those that do not overlap. How are non overlaps encoded? Which strand are they on?

<details><summary>
Answer
</summary>

<p>

```bash

bedtools intersect \
  -wao \
  -a  ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/a.bed \
  -b  ~/course/soft/bedtools2/test/intersect/b.bed
```

</p>

## Exercise 34

As a first exercise, how many of these intertions overlap human exons? Do you expect it to be a low or high proportion?

To do so download an exons bedfile from `https://s3.amazonaws.com/bedtools-tutorials/web/exons.bed` and then use bedtools intersect. Tip: it won't work because of the chromosome numbering (tip: check how chromosome numbers are encoded in both exons.bed and the vcf file, i.e. whether starting with a `chr` or not, and harmonize them using `awk`).

<p>


```bash

cd ~/course/data

curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/bedtools-tutorials/web/exons.bed

bedtools intersect -a CEU.low_coverage.2010_10.MobileElementInsertions.sites.vcf \
  -b exons.bed

## this does not work as intended! or, rather, gives some warnings.
## Why? The chr strings at the coordinates are present in one bedfile but not in the other

tail CEU.low_coverage.2010_10.MobileElementInsertions.sites.vcf

tail exons.bed

## removing the chr string from the exons bedfile

sed 's/^chr//g' exons.bed > exons_nochr.bed

head exons_nochr.bed

## this should work (chr naming conventions are equivalent)
bedtools intersect -a CEU.low_coverage.2010_10.MobileElementInsertions.sites.vcf \
  -b exons_nochr.bed

```

Are these few or lots? What would you expect?


```bash

bedtools intersect -a CEU.low_coverage.2010_10.MobileElementInsertions.sites.vcf   -b exons_nochr.bed | wc -l


```

## Exercise 35

Continuing with the mobile elements insertions, where do they insert preferentially? In active or inactive regions? To briefly explore this get the chromatin states with the highest number of insertions using the `CEU.low_coverage.2010_10.MobileElementInsertions.sites.vcf` and the Ernst's genome segmentation ([more info here](http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/)) as downloaded from `https://s3.amazonaws.com/bedtools-tutorials/web/hesc.chromHmm.bed`. Tip: then select the fourth column of the ChromHMM bedfile, sort it and count with `uniq -c`.

For further details on what is a ChromHMM segmentation (i.e. assigning functions to genomic ranges) please read [Nature Methods volume 9, pages 215–216 (2012)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1906).

<p>


```bash

cd ~/course/data

curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/bedtools-tutorials/web/hesc.chromHmm.bed

# first removing the chrstrings again

sed 's/^chr//g' hesc.chromHmm.bed > hesc.chromHmm_nochr.bed

bedtools intersect\
  -b CEU.low_coverage.2010_10.MobileElementInsertions.sites.vcf \
  -a  hesc.chromHmm_nochr.bed | awk '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c
```

So apparently there is plenty of  heterochromatin/low CNV regions, but is there an overrepresentation? How many  heterochromatin/low CNV regions are there in the whole genome?

```bash

awk '{print $4}' hesc.chromHmm_nochr.bed | sort | uniq -c

```

## Exercises block 36

Play with other real genomic data using the [BEDtools tutorial](http://quinlanlab.org/tutorials/bedtools/bedtools.html) which explores the Maurano et al paper [Systematic Localization of Common Disease-Associated Variation in Regulatory DNA published in Science, 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22955828).

Mind that the tutorial recommends creating a folder with `mkdir -p ~/workspace/monday/bedtools`: if you do so and move (`mv`) there, your path (the one you can get using `pwd`) won't be at the standard `~/course` we used till now.

Remember that the bedtools binary can be aliased using ``alias bedtools='~/course/soft/bedtools2/bin/bedtools'``.

Some of the puzzles include:

## Exercises block 37

Explore (not necessarily run) more usage examples with biological meaning using UNIX and BEDTools [http://pedagogix-tagc.univ-mrs.fr/courses/jgb53d-bd-prog/practicals/03_bedtools/](http://pedagogix-tagc.univ-mrs.fr/courses/jgb53d-bd-prog/practicals/03_bedtools/).


## Exercise 38 Sum up

Read an overview of all the file formats available at UCSC. You can upload some of the files you used during the course to the UCSC genome browser to see how do they look like. Anyway you can download, read, edit them using UNIX (i.e. `awk`, `grep` etc). And ask biological questions using bedtools/vcftools.

* [All](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html)
* [BED](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1)
* [Wiggle](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html)
* [BedGraph](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/bedgraph.html)
* [GFF](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format3)
* [GTF](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format4)
* [VCF](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format10.1)

In this course we used plain text data standards. But faster, indexed versions of such formats exist: i.e. bigWig (for wiggle), BCF (for VCF), BAM (for SAM). For instance, you can read how indexing is carried out in [bigWigs](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/bigWig.html).
